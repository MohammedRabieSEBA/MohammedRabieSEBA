## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Mohammed Rabie, an **Engineering student in Computer Science** at the *Higher National School of Computer Science Algiers* (ENSI). Passionate about **technology**, **innovation**, and **continuous learning**, I am always eager to apply my knowledge in practical, impactful ways.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- **Cybersecurity projects**: Solving complex challenges in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, with a focus on cryptography.
- **Mobile Development**: Building applications using **Flutter** and enhancing user experiences through thoughtful **UI/UX design**.
- **Backend Development**: Working with **Node.js** and mastering database management using **SQL** and **NoSQL**.
Sure! Here's the updated section with the additional technologies:

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- More about **cloud technologies**, **DevOps**, and **advanced cryptography**.
- Enhancing my skills in **full-stack development** and **scalable architecture** to create robust and efficient systems.
- **Java Spring** for building powerful, scalable backend solutions.
- **Jira** for project management and improving team collaboration.
- **Agile project management systems** to streamline development workflows and improve team efficiency.


### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- **Innovative software development projects**, particularly in **mobile apps**, **web platforms**, and **cybersecurity**.
- **CTF teams** or **hackathons** to challenge my problem-solving and cryptography skills.
- **Open-source projects** to contribute and grow as a developer in an impactful community.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- **Advanced cryptography techniques** and **security algorithms** to sharpen my skills further.
- Collaborating on **large-scale projects** to gain more experience in enterprise-level development.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- **Mobile development** using **Flutter**.
- **Backend systems** with **Node.js** and **database management**.
- **Security challenges** in **CTF** competitions.
- My experience in **project management** and **team leadership**, especially during my time as a project leader in a multidisciplinary project at ENSI.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:  
- **LinkedIn**: [[My LinkedIn profile]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seba-mohammed-rabie-580623261/)    

### âš¡ Fun fact:
- During my second year of class preparatory in Algeria, I led a team to develop a **multiplatform application** (Web, Desktop, and Mobile) as part of a **multidisciplinary project**, achieving one of the highest grades in the class. We created **Machfa**, a dynamic platform that aims to change how users interact with their health data, similar to Doctolib.

Letâ€™s build the future of technology together! ðŸš€
